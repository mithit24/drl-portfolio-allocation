# DRL Portfolio Allocation

This project implements a **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** framework for multi-asset portfolio allocation using high-frequency ETF data. The system trains a Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) agent to allocate capital dynamically across multiple assets, with realistic trading frictions and feature engineering.

##  Key Features
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated download and cleaning of 2-minute ETF data from Yahoo Finance.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Momentum, volatility, RSI, MACD, Z-scores, and volume dynamics built per asset.  
- **Custom Gym Environment**: `PortfolioEnv` and `PortfolioGym` simulate realistic portfolio trading with:
  - Execution costs
  - Volume participation constraints
  - Risk penalties and turnover costs
- **RL Training**: Soft Actor–Critic agent (Stable-Baselines3) trained with vectorized environments.  
- **Evaluation & Benchmarking**: Compare against SPY and equal-weight portfolios, compute Sharpe ratios, and visualize equity curves.
